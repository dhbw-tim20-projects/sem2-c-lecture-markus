Canusa Street

Canusa Street (French: rue Canusa) is the only part of the Canada-US border that runs down the middle of a street. The street separates Beebe Plain, Vermont from the Beebe Plain area of Stanstead, Quebec and is a part of Quebec Route 247.

History and description

Local legend claims that a group of rather drunken surveyors, when given the task of determining the US-Canada border line in the region (nominally at 45.00N), decided to place the border right through the center of the village along what is now Canusa Street. On the current cadastral graphic matrix however, the border line is drawn along the southern border to the street, suggesting that it is entirely located within Canada.
At the west end of Canusa is the Beebe Plain-Beebe Border Crossing. Immediately facing them is a solid granite line house. This building (built as a store in the 1820s) was for a time the world's only international post office. It had one postmaster, but two doors and two postal counters, each serving customers from a different country.

The Beebe Plain library is partly in the US and partly in Canada as well.
