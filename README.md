# dhbw-lecture-c

The scripts in this repository are created during the dhbw C/C++ lectures. I have non experiences with theses languages so far which means there is a good chance that this code is trash.


## Build

I try to create build scripts for every module. They can be found in the related subdirectory as `./build.sh`
